        <p>Clearfree is a new partnership developing software products to
        reduce the workload of clinical radiologists
        especially those involved in large breast cancer screening programs.</p>

.. class:: col-md-4

    Background
        Emerging from
        the insights of one of UKâ€™s leading breast cancer units
        and cutting-edge AI researchers, Clearfree is a convergence
        hub for researchers, developers, and radiologists.

    Products
        Our initial product
        uses artificial intelligence to determine whether a radiologist needs to
        examine a patient's 3D current breast image set, based on comparison with
        prior images.
